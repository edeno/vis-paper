#### Importance of Visualization for Open Neuroscience
Sharing datasets is important for ensuring the reproducibility of results, meta-analyses, as benchmarks for computational models, and getting the greatest utility out of datasets [@poldrack_making_2014] --- particularly for datasets that are hard to collect such as those from non-human primates.

One challenge for the sharing of datasets is providing users with a way to find the datasets they want. Datasets provided in numerical form in non-standardized formats are hard to navigate and limit the usefulness of sharing the data. As electrophysiology dataset sharing becomes more common, it will be important to have tools to do preliminary investigations of these open datasets. Online interactive visualization tools such as ours may provide a way for quick exploration of datasets online --- enabling users to understand the datasets before performing more in-depth analyses. Indeed, the Allen Brain Institute --- which shares massive neuroscience datasets online --- makes extensive use of online visualizations to enable users to find the appropriate datasets. Because our tools encompass many common types of analysis for electrophysiological data,  we hope our tools and future extensions can be used in a similar manner.
