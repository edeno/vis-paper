abstract: |
  Electrophysiology datasets in neuroscience are becoming richer and more complex as data is collected on multiple scales, dataset sizes increase, and more sophisticated questions are asked of the data. Visualization is an essential tool for understanding these datasets at all stages of analysis, but current practices in visualization of electrophysiological data are limited in their ability to efficiently compare between visualizations (such as between spike raster plots of neurons or between regression model coefficients and raster plots) and filter complex data (such as comparing only correlations within a brain area versus comparing correlations between brain areas). Such difficulties are only magnified as the amount of data increases.

  This paper describes a set of composable, web-enabled interactive visualization tools developed for use in electrophysiological studies. These tools were developed to enhance exploratory data analysis, checking of raw data and statistical modeling assumptions, and data presentation for large, complex and multi-scale neuroscience data. Data from several experiments were used to test to the tools. These visualization tools are viewable in the web browser, making them easily shareable online, and open-source, allowing for modification and development by the neuroscience community.
