## Materials and Methods

### Design
Our approach is to create modular interactive visualizations that can be extended to more complicated visualizations, linked together to provide an integrated view of an electrophysiological dataset --- from raw data to statistical summary or from smaller to larger spatial scale --- or used independently.
All visualizations are built with javascript using the open source software D3 --- a visualization library --- and Bootstrap --- a page layout library.

#### Modular, Open Source
 To that end, we have built the visualizations

Is it easy for the user to implement their own algorithm for assessing connectivity?

#### Importing Data and Configuring Visualizations

#### Linking and Sharing Visualizations

#### Exporting Static Figures for Use in Publication
