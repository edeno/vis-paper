## Materials and Methods

### Design
A set of tools is only as useful as the number of people that can use them. We decided that each visualization should adhere to a set of principles to make them maximally useful (maybe bring in some reference here?). To that end, our approach is to create interactive visualizations that are:

1. **Shareable** --- so others can easily view the visualizations online or in print.
2. **Modular** --- so the visualizations can be used independently or linked together to provide an integrated view of an electrophysiological dataset.
3. **Extendable** --- so others can implement their own visualization algorithms and modify the visualizations for their own use.
4. **Configurable** --- so visualizations can dynamically display different datasets or be preset to a particular view state.

#### Shareable
To make the visualizations shareable, the visualizations were written with modern web technologies --- HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They can be deployed via a local or remotely hosted webserver and viewed with any modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE9+).

Each visualization has its own online software repository. The repositories are hosted on Github and can be downloaded and installed --- including all software dependencies --- using the node package manager (npm). This ensures the development tools, such as deploying a local webserver (allowing the user to view the visualization on their own computer without having to host it remotely) are included.

Static visualizations can also be exported for publication purposes. Each visualization includes a button to export and save the current state of the visualization to the scalable vector graphics (SVG) format. This format can be imported into a graphics program of choice --- such as Inkscape or Illustrator --- for further modification.


#### Modular
 To that end, we have built the visualizations


#### Linking and Sharing Visualizations

#### Exporting Static Figures for Use in Publication

#### Importing Data and Configuring Visualizations
