To determine whether gamma synchrony is common throughout the ventral stream, we recorded from neurons in the superficial and deep layers of V1, V2, and V4 in two rhesus monkeys. We found an unexpected striking difference in gamma synchrony in the superficial vs. deep layers. In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40–60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial layers, whereas the deep layers showed maximal coherence at low frequencies (6–16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V2 and V4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the deep layers, alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and deep layers. The results suggest that synchrony plays very different roles in feedback and feedforward projections.","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/27/11262","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1011284108","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Buffalo","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Fries","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Landman","given":"Rogier"},{"family":"Buschman","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Desimone","given":"Robert"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,5]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,8]]},"PMID":"21690410","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

Does this synchrony result from intrinsic activity in visual cortex or from inputs from other structures? Using paired recordings in the frontal eye field (FEF) and area V4, we found that attention to a stimulus in their joint receptive field leads to enhanced oscillatory coupling between the two areas, particularly at gamma frequencies. This coupling appeared to be initiated by FEF and was time-shifted by about 8 to 13 milliseconds across a range of frequencies. Considering the expected conduction and synaptic delays between the areas, this time-shifted coupling at gamma frequencies may optimize the postsynaptic impact of spikes from one area upon the other, improving cross-area communication with attention.","URL":"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5931/1207","DOI":"10.1126/science.1171402","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Gregoriou","given":"Georgia G."},{"family":"Gotts","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Huihui"},{"family":"Desimone","given":"Robert"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5,29]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,29]]},"PMID":"19478185","container-title-short":"Science"},

Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40% more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7207/abs/nature07140.html","DOI":"10.1038/nature07140","ISSN":"0028-0836","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Pillow","given":"Jonathan W."},{"family":"Shlens","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Paninski","given":"Liam"},{"family":"Sher","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Litke","given":"Alan M."},{"family":"Chichilnisky","given":"E.

Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input–output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12160.html","DOI":"10.1038/nature12160","ISSN":"0028-0836","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Rigotti","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Barak","given":"Omri"},{"family":"Warden","given":"Melissa R."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiao-Jing"},{"family":"Daw","given":"Nathaniel D."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Earl K."},{"family":"Fusi","given":"Stefano"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,19]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,18]]},"container-title-short":"Nature"},

Microelectrode recordings have characterized the activation of single neurons and fMRI has unveiled brain-wide activation patterns. Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661305002421","DOI":"10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.011","ISSN":"1364-6613","author":[{"family":"Fries","given":"Pascal"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,28]]},"title-short":"A mechanism for cognitive dynamics","container-title-short":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences"},
